config NVMAP_PAGE_POOLS
	bool "Use page pools to reduce allocation overhead"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP
	default y
	help
	  say Y here to reduce the alloction overhead, which is significant
	  for uncached, writecombine and inner cacheable memories as it
	  involves changing page attributes during every allocation per page
	  and flushing cache. Alloc time is reduced by allcoating the pages
	  ahead and keeping them aside. The reserved pages would be released
	  when system is low on memory and acquired back during release of
	  memory.

config NVMAP_PAGE_POOL_DEBUG

	  Say Y here to fill up the page pools during page pool init time.
	  This helps in faster alloctions right from the early alloction

	  Say Y here to avoid cache maint on all CPU's during inner cache maint
	  by set/ways. When L1 and L2 are inner caches, cache maint on one
	  CPU is enough. When L1 is inner and L2 is outer, cache maint on
	  all CPU's is necessary during L1 cache maint by set/ways.

config NVMAP_OUTER_CACHE_MAINT_BY_SET_WAYS

	  Set to Y if you would like nvmap to stash maps when using dma
	  bufs. This will speed up remapping of the same handle at the cost
	  of using more IOVA space.

config NVMAP_DMABUF_STASH_STATS
	bool "Enable stat tracking on the stash"
	depends on NVMAP_DMABUF_STASH
	help
	  Say Y to enable tracking of basic cache statistics on the dmabuf

	  debugging memory leaks.

config NVMAP_FORCE_ZEROED_USER_PAGES
	bool "Only alloc zeroed pages for user space"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP
	help
	  Say Y here to force zeroing of pages allocated for user space. This
	  avoids leaking kernel secure data to user space. This can add
	  significant overhead to allocation operations depending on the
	  allocation size requested.

config NVMAP_USE_CMA_FOR_CARVEOUT

	help
	  NvMap handles are represented with FD's in the user processes.

config NVMAP_DEFER_FD_RECYCLE
	bool "Defer FD recycle"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP
	help
	  Say Y here to enable deferred FD recycle.
	  A released nvmap handle would release memory and FD. This FD
	  can be reused immediately for subsequent nvmap allocation req in
	  the same process. Any buggy code in client process that continues to
	  use FD of released allocation would continue to use new allocation
	  and can lead to undesired consequences, which can be hard to debug.
	  Enabling this option would defer recycling FD for longer time and
	  allows debugging incorrect FD references by clients by returning errors
	  for the accesses that occur after handle/FD release.

config NVMAP_DEFER_FD_RECYCLE_MAX_FD
	hex "FD number to start free FD recycle"
	depends on NVMAP_DEFER_FD_RECYCLE
