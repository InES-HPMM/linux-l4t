* Samsung Exynos Power Domains

Exynos processors include support for multiple power domains which are used
to gate power to one or more peripherals on the processor.

Required Properties:
- compatible: should be one of the following.
    * samsung,exynos4210-pd - for exynos4210 type power domain.
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
    region.
- #power-domain-cells: number of cells in power domain specifier;
    must be 0.

Node of a device using power domains must have a samsung,power-domain property
defined with a phandle to respective power domain.

Example:

	lcd0: power-domain-lcd0 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-pd";
		reg = <0x10023C00 0x10>;
		#power-domain-cells = <0>;
	};

Example of the node using power domain:

	mfc_pd: power-domain@10044060 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-pd";
		reg = <0x10044060 0x20>;
		clocks = <&clock CLK_FIN_PLL>, <&clock CLK_MOUT_SW_ACLK333>,
			<&clock CLK_MOUT_USER_ACLK333>;
		clock-names = "oscclk", "pclk0", "clk0";
		#power-domain-cells = <0>;
	};

See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power_domain.txt for description
of consumer-side bindings.
